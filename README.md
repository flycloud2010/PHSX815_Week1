# PHSX815_Week1
Computing, Algorithm, and Probability Basics

This repository contains codes that create a list of random number using bitwise operations. More functionality has been added to the python folder.
The macro and src will be update soon.

The python code will create a .txt file that contains a list of random floats, which is then used to plot a histogram.
